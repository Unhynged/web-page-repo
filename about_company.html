<h1>What is a Character Backstory?</h1>
	<!-- Add link for the WotC Character Sheet -->
<p> Every DnD character has a story, even before the campaign starts. A backsdtory tells the tale of your hero as they grew up and became the adventurer they are today. The official <a href="media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/dnd/DDALRoD_CharacterSheet.pdf">WotC Character Sheet</a> has a couple of different sections that delve into a character's motivation. There are:
	<br /><br />
	- Personality Traits<br />
	- Ideals<br />
	- Bonds<br />
	- Flaws<br />
	- Appearance<br />
	- Backstory<br />
	<br /><br />
	Seems simple enough, right? Well, actually it is, but I think we can do a lot better.<br /><br />
	I personally don't like the way WotC has approached the character backstory on their official sheets. It feels sterile and neglected. I also disagree with the approach of splitting a character's traits, bonds, flaws and appearance away from their backstory. In my opinion, a character's backstory will dictate their bonds, ideals, flaws, and personality traits. It is the events that has transpired in their past that have shaped everything about them, all the way down to their appearance..</p>
